The files in the src folder is the source code of the project and it includes loadFile.java, Main.java, selectSensor.java, Sensor,java, sortSensor.java, sortTarget.java and Target.java.
Main.java is the entry point of the whole program.

And there is two execution files, Sensor select.jar and Sensor select.exe, you can open either of the two.

The program needs to input a txt file, providing the information of sensors and targets, the format should be like the test.txt. The first row is sensor's data, and it should include it's x axis, y axis and cost. The second row is target's data, it should include the target's x axis and y axis.
